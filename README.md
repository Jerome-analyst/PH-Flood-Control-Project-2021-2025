# Philippines Flood Control Projects (2021–2025)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Power BI–based data analysis and visualization** of the Philippines’ flood control initiatives from 2021 to 2025. The analysis focuses on monitoring project costs, contractor performance, and implementation progress across multiple regions.

Flood management is a critical national priority, yet the data on infrastructure projects is often large, fragmented, and difficult to interpret. Using **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**, I developed a solution that cleans, structures, and visualizes the data. The result is an interactive dashboard that highlights project distribution, costs, and completion trends in an intuitive format.


## Objectives

The objectives of this project are to design and develop a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** with the following goals:

* Track **total project costs** across multiple years to monitor long-term investment.
* Analyze performance by **project type, contractor, and district engineering office** to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement.
* Provide **interactive filtering** by year, region, municipality, and contractor for flexible exploration.
* Deliver **actionable insights** through clear and intuitive visualizations that support transparency and evidence-based decision-making.

## Tools & Techniques

This project leverages a combination of software platforms and analytical techniques to transform raw government data into structured insights:

* **Software**: Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI
* **Features**:

  * SQL for structured queries and database management
  * Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and automation
  * Power BI for building KPI tiles, interactive filters, and dashboards
* **Techniques**:

  * Data cleaning and preparation for accuracy and consistency
  * KPI calculation for cost and project counts
  * Trend and variance analysis to uncover yearly and regional patterns


## Data Preparation

The data preparation stage focused on consolidating and refining raw datasets to ensure reliability:

* Combined datasets across **contract IDs, costs, project type, and location**.
* Cleaned and standardized entries to address missing values, remove inconsistencies, and unify formats.
* Created calculated fields such as **average project cost** and **project counts by type**.
* Automated repetitive transformations using Python and SQL before loading into Power BI.

This process established a robust foundation for accurate reporting and visualization.


## Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into multiple project dimensions. Key features include:

* **Total Project Costs**: ₱542B invested across 9,778 projects.
* **Project Costs by Year**: 2022 had the highest allocation (₱203B).
* **Average Project Cost**: ₱55M, ranging from ₱1M to ₱290M.
* **Flood Control by Type of Work**: Majority are **flood mitigation structures (64.65%)**, followed by slope protection, drainage systems, and dikes.
* **Top Contractors**: Legacy (112 projects), QM Builders (88), Alpha & Co. (84), St. Timothy (83), Sunwest (67).
* **District Engineering Offices**: Bulacan 1st DEO leads with 452 projects; Metro Manila and Bulacan 2nd also show high activity.
* **Projects by Month**: Peak project activity occurred in May 2023 with 2,646 projects.


## Key Insights

The analysis uncovered several critical insights:

* **Budget Allocation**: 2022 recorded the largest funding, suggesting prioritization of flood control in that year.
* **Concentration of Projects**: A significant share of work is concentrated in Bulacan and Metro Manila, highlighting regional vulnerability.
* **Contractor Involvement**: A small group of contractors handles the majority of projects, showing reliance on select firms.
* **Work Type Focus**: Investment is heavily skewed toward flood mitigation structures, with less focus on rehabilitation and slope protection.
* **Seasonality**: Project implementation peaks in mid-year (especially May), which may align with fiscal planning cycles.


## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can enhance project efficiency and impact:

1. **Diversify Contractor Engagement**
   Reduce reliance on a small group of contractors by engaging more firms to minimize risks of delays and capacity bottlenecks.

2. **Balance Project Types**
   Allocate more resources to **rehabilitation and drainage systems** to ensure long-term resilience, not just new construction.

3. **Regional Focus**
   Increase investment in other flood-prone regions outside Bulacan and Metro Manila to achieve more balanced flood protection nationwide.

4. **Optimize Project Timing**
   Distribute project initiation more evenly throughout the year to avoid seasonal bottlenecks.

5. **Data-Driven Monitoring**
   Regularly update and monitor dashboards to track progress, ensure transparency, and identify early warning signs of delays.
